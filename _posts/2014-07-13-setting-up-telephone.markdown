what we did today is configure a grand stream telephone system which will let you forward calls and even recored voice mail and forward it to an email
here is what we did


1.  fixed ip address we went into its configuration and made it request the ip `10.10.10.10` so now it has a static ip 

1.  then we made it work with ntp time

1.  then configured the email so it can send the voice mail
